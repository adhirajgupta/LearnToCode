		<h1>What is HTML5 + more tags?</h1>
		<p>HTML has gone through many versions.  The latest version - HTML5 - has added some awesome new features and tags.  It would take an entire book 
			to explain everything in HTML5 and how it works, but what's important to note is that not all HTML5 features are available in all browsers, but most features 
			are available, and if you see something that is HTML5 - chances are you can use it.  From my perspective - HTML5 adds some awesome new tags that 
			help you organize content in the document.<p>
		<h2>Some commonly used tags and their description</h2>
		<p>Note: a tag can be uppercase or lowercase, it doesn't matter.  P is the same as p...
		<ul>
			<li><b>&lt;P&gt;: The paragraph tag.  Used for text</li>
			<li><b>&lt;H1&gt; - &lt;H5&gt;: Heading/Header tags</li>
			<li><b>&lt;SPAN&gt;: The span tag is an 'empty' tag.  It's mainly used so you can later style the content how you want with no defaults</li>
			<li><b>&lt;DVI&gt;: The Division tag.  This is a block-level tag (meaning that any content that it will be displayed on it's own line, and content displayed after will be on it's own line.  Used to divide one section of content from another</li>
			<li><b>&lt;I&gt;: Italics - cause the content inside to be <i>italic</i></li>
			<li><b>&lt;B&gt;: Bold - cause the content inside to be <b>bold</b></li>
			<li><b>&lt;IMG&gt;: The Image tag.  Unlike the content tags, this has a special user and requires attributes.  Will be explained later.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Opening and Closing Tags</h2>
		<p>Every tag (with very few exceptions) have a beginning and ending tag.  The beginning tag is the tag name, and the end has a / before it.  For example, &lt;p&gt; is the start tag for a P and &lt;/p&gt; would be the end.  Any content between
		the tags would be part of that P tag.</p>
		<h2>Why do we need tags?</h2>
		<p>Tags help to logically organize content and tell the web browser how to display content.  Additionally, you can use things like classes and IDs to apply different styling (see CSS tutorials).</p>
