<!-- 
This example goes over creating the basic of a front-end form using HTML and minimal CSS.  Forms have 
different default styling over different browsers and it is important to understand how a basic
form would look.  I recommend opening this example in at least Firefox, Chrome, and whatever 
your pre-installed browser is (Safari on Mac or IE/Edge on Windows)

At some point there will be a PHP example on handling form posts.  To do anything with the posted 
data, you will need a back-end script.

There will also be a Javascript version that will cover basic validation.

		<!-- below is the beginning to Alice in Wonderland.  The text has been marked up with basic HTML and
		quite a few span and div tags with classes in them.  There are a few different classes, and a few differnt 
		situations - some tags with multiple classes, some with just one. -->
		
		<h1>Basic Form Example</h1>

		<!-- A form has 2 attributes - Action and Method.
			Action is the location of the script/page you want the values of the form to be submitted to
			method is either:
				get - all values are sent as part of the URL.  For example: basic_forms.html?value1=abcd&value2=nwene&...
				post - the values are put in the header of the request for the page - so they are not in the URL.  this allows you to 
							pass larger amounts of data, and files.				
		 -->
			<p>There are a few different types of form inputs that do different things:</p>
		<form action="./basic_forms.html" method="get">
			<!-- A label allows you to have text that describes the input field.  If you click on the label
			name, it will take you to the input field.  It is also important for accessibility, as the screen reader
			will read out the label information. -->
			<!-- the input tag doesn't have an open and a close tag.  You can add a /> at the end instead of a > to denote that 
			it is self-closing -->
			<!-- form elements have a 'name' attribute which is the value that will be passed when you submit the form.
			Each element needs an ID which will link the label.  For example putting 'nick' for the name
			would result in: basic_forms.html?your_name=nick -->
			<div>
				<label for="your_name">Name: </label><input type='text' name='your_name' id='your_name'/>
			</div>
			<!-- I've put each example in a <div> so that each item will be on it's own line.-->
			<div>
				<label for="favorite_season">Favorite Season: </label>
				<!-- A select/option is how you create a dropdown.  You can provide a list of options. -->
				<select name="favorite_season" id='favorite_season'>
					<option>Summer</option>
					<option>Spring</option>
					<option>Winter</option>
					<option>Fall</option>
				</select>
			</div>
						
			<div>
				<label for="favorite_time_of_day">Favorite Time of Day: </label>
				<!-- If you want the value that is passed by the form to be different from what the user sees, you 
				can define a value parameter.  -->
				<select name="favorite_time_of_day" id='favorite_time_of_day'>
					<option value='06:00'>Dawn</option>
					<option value='12:00'>Noon</option>
					<option value='18:00'>Dusk</option>
					<option value='00:00'>Midnight</option>
				</select>
			</div>
			
			<!-- Radio Buttons - you can only select one.  The must have the same name -->
			<div>
				<p>What is 8+4?</p>
				<!-- The IDs for the elements have to be words.  HTML and javascript do not let you start 
				and ID with a number.  You can have a number within, but not at the start. -->
				<input type='radio' name='math_question' id='eight' value='8'/><label for='eight'>8</label><br/> <!-- the BR tag adds a new line - or a line break -->
				<input type='radio' name='math_question' id='ten' value='10'/><label for='ten'>10</label><br/>
				<input type='radio' name='math_question' id='twelve' value='12'/><label for='twelve'>12</label><br/>
				<input type='radio' name='math_question' id='fourteen' value='14'/><label for='fourteen'>14</label><br/>
			</div>
			
			<div>
				<p>What foods do you like?</p>
				<!-- A checkbox is also self-closing tag.  -->
				<input type='checkbox' name='pizza' id='pizza'/><label for='pizza'>Pizza</label><br/>
				<input type='checkbox' name='pasta' id='pasta'/><label for='pasta'>Pasta</label><br/>
				<input type='checkbox' name='chicken' id='chicken'/><label for='chicken'>Chicken</label><br/>
				<input type='checkbox' name='banans' id='banans'/><label for='bananas'>Bananas</label><br/>
