	<!-- An HTML document starts with the <html> tag and ends with </html>  Everything between is part of the document -->
	<!-- A document usually has a <head> tag which is information that describes the document.  For example, the title -->
	<head>
		<title>Basic HTML Document</title>
	</head>
	<!-- The body is the content that is displayed -->

		<h1>This is an HTML document</h1>
		<p>Believe it or not, this document can actually be even simpler.  If you are viewing this in a browser, right-click and select 
		"View Page Source" to see the code for this document.<p>
		<p>HTML is a markup language - meaning that you use tags to describe the content within.  For example, this paragraph is in a &lt;p&gt; tag.  There are a bunch of different tags in HTML.  For nearly all tags, the only real difference
		between them is default behavior.  The &lt;h1&gt; tag used for "This is an HTML document" makes the text larger.  H1 stands for "header level 1."  There are pre-defined headers for level 1-5.  H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5...</p>
		<p>One quirk of HTML is that it ignores something called "whitespace" which means extra spaces beyond the first.  If you      look      at      the
		
		
		
		code for      this sentence, you            will see that there     are tons of extra spaces.</p>

		<h2>Opening and Closing Tags</h2>
		<p>Every tag (with very few exceptions) have a beginning and ending tag.  The beginning tag is the tag name, and the end has a / before it.  For example, &lt;p&gt; is the start tag for a P and &lt;/p&gt; would be the end.  Any content between
		the tags would be part of that P tag.</p>
		<h2>Why do we need tags?</h2>
		<p>Tags help to logically organize content and tell the web browser how to display content.  Additionally, you can use things like classes and IDs to apply different styling (see CSS tutorials).</p>
