To avoid having to reformat this, and because I wish to keep the formatting, I'm providing a link to the Google Doc that contains the full guide.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M8Dksif4RtS99_uqOstsZVDqqrdqmnPD7PzNsrp4RyQ/edit?usp=sharing

If someone wishes to re-write this using clean HTML (export as HTML from Google Docs is less than ideal) that would be greatly appreciated.

Here are some additional resources:
