## <span>Area</span> <span class="c16 c8">1 - Understanding the HTML Document</span>

*   <span class="c2">What is HTML / XML / XHTML</span>

<span>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is tagging language for defining structure. It is the guts that runs the content display of all websites and many of the apps you use on your phone or tablet. HTML is a specific type of XML. XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and defines any tagging language that uses <> style tags. The full list of HTML tags can be found here [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp?utm_source%3Dtwitterfeed%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&sa=D&ust=1512061793318000&usg=AFQjCNGnc0GQ78A5h1hsjRANdPmGaqMMGA)</span><span class="c2">]. XHTML, which stands for eXtensible HyperText Markup Language, is strict HTML, which means that if you fail to close a tag properly, it will result in an error. If you fail to close a tag properly in regular HTML, it will simply assume that one tag closes where the next begins.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">All examples I put will be XHTML compliant, and all of your documents should strive to be as well.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">HTML, at its core, is very simple. You can create a document with only the knowledge of 3 tags:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><html></span>

<span class="c2">        <body></span>

<span class="c2">                <p>This is a Paragraph</p></span>

<span class="c2">        </body></span>

<span class="c2"></html></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>All HTML documents are wrapped in an <html> tag. The first tag, <html>, is the open tag, and the last tag, </html>, is the close. All closing tags are indicated by a / (forward slash). Everything from the start tag to the end tag is known as an element, or an individual component of an HTML document. The tags indicate that everything between the <html> and </html> should be interpreted as HTML. They also indicate that everything between the <html> and </html></span> <span class="c5">belongs</span><span class="c2"> to that tag. The same is true for any other tag. So, the <body> and <p> (paragraph) tags belong to the <html> tag, and the <p> tag belongs to the <body> tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c11 c8 c5">A note about indentation:</span>

<span class="c2">HTML ignores whitespace (carriage returns, extra spaces beyond the first, tabs, indents, etc), this allows you to format your code in a way that makes it easy to write and edit. In coding, indents (tabs) are used to help keep track of where you are, and what tag you are working in. All of my examples will follow this format, and it is a good habit to have, but it is worth noting, the above example can also be written like so and display exactly the same:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span><html><body><p>This is a Paragraph</p></body></html></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">The document structure</span>

<span class="c2">Every HTML page has two sections, a <head> and a <body>. The <head> is optional and stands for header. It is where you can include additional files (such as a CSS file for controlling the look of your document), include a font, include a JavaScript file (for adding interactivity), or define document metadata (such as the title of your document, search keywords, description, etc).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">All content you want to display gets placed in the <body> tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If you’re new to HTML/XML or tagged content, try to think of HTML as a house. Let’s create our HTML house:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><html></span>

<span class="c2"></html></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">A house has an address, and some other non-physical properties - those go in the head. Things in the head tag that hold data are called "meta" (for metadata) tags.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><html></span>

<span class="c2">        <head></span>

<span class="c2">                <meta name="address" value="1 Pleasant Lane"/></span>

<span class="c2">                <meta name="year_built" value="2014"/></span>

<span class="c2">        </head></span>

<span class="c2"></html></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">*Note: In the above, the <meta> tags do not have a closing tag. Some tags can be (or must be) self-closing, meaning that they end with /> instead of > which denotes that it is the end of that tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Our house also has a structure. It is made up of rooms. To keep things fully HTML, let’s call our rooms</span> <span class="c5">divisions</span><span class="c2"> or divs (the <div> tag)</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><html></span>

<span class="c2">        <head> … </head></span>

<span class="c2">        <body></span>

<span class="c2">                <div>The Living Room</div></span>

<span class="c2">                <div>The Dining Room</div></span>

<span class="c2">                <div>The Bedroom Room</div></span>

<span class="c2">                <div>The Kitchen</div></span>

<span class="c2">                <div>The Bathroom</div></span>

<span class="c2">        </body></span>

<span class="c2"></html></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">That’s it.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Structure vs. Style Tags</span>

<span>HTML contains quite a few tags -- more than 100, in fact -- but in most cases, your document will only use a handful of different tags (probably 10 or 20). There are two different types of tags,</span> <span class="c5">structural</span><span> and</span> <span class="c5">formatting</span> <span>(style)</span><span class="c5">.</span><span class="c2"> A structural tag implies that the content inside has some significant structure. A formatting or style tag simply changes the way the text is displayed.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In the house example, the <div> tag is a structural tag that denotes the contents are a room. I will demonstrate later how we can label that <div> in a special way to help style it later.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The style tags are a relic of older versions of HTML where there was no CSS to change the way text was displayed. Those tags are <b> (bold), <i> (italic), <strong>, <em> (emphasis), and <center>. While the first 4 tags are still valid, it is recommended that you do</span> <span class="c5">not</span><span class="c2"> use them as it implies formatting a fixed link between formatting and structure.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">An example of why you would not want to use the <b> tag to bold something is as follows:</span>

<span class="c2">Let’s say you were setting up a dictionary and wanted to make all the definitions appear bold. You may set up your definitions as such:</span>

<span><div><b>Happy:</b></span> <span class="c18 c14">delighted, pleased, or glad, as over a particular thing.</div></span>

<span class="c18 c14"></span>

<span class="c14">If your boss decides that all definitions should be</span> <span class="c14 c5">italic</span><span class="c14"> instead of</span> <span class="c14 c8">bold</span><span class="c18 c14">, you either have to overwrite the default display for <b> tags (which can work, but makes it difficult to look at the source and see what is going on).</span>

<span class="c14 c18"></span>

<span class="c14">By using structure tags (and CSS, discussed in later lessons), we can achieve much smarter results.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 1:</span>

*   <span class="c2">Creating a well-styled document</span>

<span>Your first assignment is to get started creating a document. Using any plain-text editor of your choice (Notepad, TextEdit, NotePad++ [</span><span class="c7">[http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://notepad-plus-plus.org/&sa=D&ust=1512061793326000&usg=AFQjCNFqghNLEJXJMc-A1cZLUVD5eMdLug)</span><span class="c2">], etc), create a new document. Make sure you are on "plain text" setting. In TextEdit click "format" then "Make plain text." Notepad is plain text by default.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">First, create your opening and closing HTML tags.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Next create a <head> and <body> tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Add a <title> tag to the <head> and name your page. The title can be anything you want it to be. It will appear as the tab or window title when you open the HTML file in your web browser, but it will not appear on the page itself.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In your body, create a <div> with 4 <p>’s (paragraphs) contained within it. In those paragraphs, tell me what your goals for this class are.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Save that file to your desktop and name it</span> <span class="c8">index.html</span><span class="c2">. Open up a new browser window or tab and drag/drop the file from your desktop into that tab. It will display your 4 paragraphs.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">* Why index.html? It is a naming convention from the early days of the world wide web that index.html is the default file that is loaded in a directory. You can technically name it anything you want, but for this course, we’ll use that name.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c8 c16">Area 2 - Including Additional Files & CSS Part 1</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Ordering & Display</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">I’ve discussed how HTML should house the structure of your content. What about display? The display of your content should be controlled by CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). CSS is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and format of a document written in HTML and other markup languages. CSS tells the web browser how to display HTML content. CSS can be applied on 4 different levels, in this order:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

1.  <span class="c2">Directly on the element (should be avoided when writing HTML)</span>
2.  <span class="c2">Element ID</span>
3.  <span class="c2">Element Class</span>
4.  <span class="c2">Tag type</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">So far, I’ve only showed you the tag type. So, in our first sample document, the <p> tags are a tag type of "p". HTML has 3 additional optional elements that can be added to tags - class, id, and style.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">An element with all those tags is below:</span>

<span class="c2"><p id="my_first_paragraph" class="no-indent" style="">My first paragraph.</p></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The order of those elements within the tag is not required, but good style says id, class, then style. As noted, you should avoid setting the style directly on the element when it comes to creating your HTML/CSS.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The ordering for CSS is important, as it determines how conflicts are resolved. Let’s say you define all <p> tags to have an indent, but the</span> <span class="c5">id</span><span class="c2"> of "my_first_paragraph" to have no indents. Since ID is higher up on the list, the <p> will not have indents.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c5">Note about naming</span>

<span class="c5">Id</span><span> and</span> <span class="c5">class</span> <span class="c2">names cannot have spaces in them, and should be alphanumeric with _ or - in place of spaces. There are many different naming conventions that work for different people. I suggest you name things logically so you can read the code and understand what is being displayed.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Using the <HEAD> to add additional files</span>

<span class="c2">While you can technically write CSS code directly in your HTML document, it makes things difficult to read, and can make your HTML document very long. Additionally, your CSS should be shared by multiple documents.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">You can include a CSS file in your HTML document by using the code:</span>

<span class="c2"><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"/></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The / at the end of the tag means that it is a self-closing tag (has no contents). It is short-hand notation for:</span>

<span class="c2"><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></link></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">There are a few tags that HTML will allow you to leave unclosed - the <link>, <br> (line break), and <img> (image) tags are a few examples, but in all my examples, I will include the / to make them self-closing and therefore XHTML compliant.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Next, copy the self-closing tag above into the <head> of your html document. You’ll now need to create a new file and save it in the sample folder as your HTML document. This new file will be named "style.css".</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let us start by defining how the paragraph tag should display. In style.css, input:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p {</span>

<span class="c2">        text-indent: 24px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Then save, and load your document in a web browser of your choosing. You should see each paragraph indented 24 pixels (px). Measurements in CSS can be done in many ways (</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp&sa=D&ust=1512061793332000&usg=AFQjCNFJ-O3Q8Mh0eax6RHO_A5Ab1CuNqQ)</span><span>) but I recommend you do them in PX or EM. EM is a relative term for active font size, so a text-indent of 2em would be bigger for a paragraph with larger text, and smaller for one with smaller text, whereas 24px will be the same in both cases.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Controlling display with CSS</span>

<span class="c2">Basic CSS can be broken down into two sections:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">(conditions) {</span>

<span class="c2">        (styles)</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The conditions are a list of tags, ids, and classes. The styles are a list of properties to apply to anything that meets the conditions. In the above example, "p" denotes the <p> tag. The condition is "all p tags" and the style applied is "text-indent: 24px;" Each style has 4 elements.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Style Name</span>
*   <span class="c2">:</span>
*   <span class="c2">Value</span>
*   <span class="c2">;</span>

<span>The style name is</span> <span class="c5">what</span><span class="c2">, the colon (:) separates the name from the value, and each statement is ended with a semicolon (;).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">As noted before, we can have tags, classes, and IDs in our CSS. To denote a tag, we simply write its name. div for <div> tags, p for <p> tags, etc. For classes, we add a period (.) before the name.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">.no-ident {</span>

<span class="c2">        text-indent: 0px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">says that anything with the class "no-indent" should have a text-indent of 0 pixels. A tag can have multiple classes, separated by spaces.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><p class="definition no-indent first_on_page">Happy</p></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">To represent IDs, you preface the ID with #.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">#my_first_paragraph {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-size: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In your conditions, you can combine elements in a boolean fashion. Using a space to separate denotes AND, while using a comma (,) denotes OR. For example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p, div { … }</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">says apply the styles to all <p> and <div></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p .no-ident { … }</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">says apply the styles to all <p> tags that also have the class ".no-indent"</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">You can combine these as well:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p .no-indent, div { … }</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">which applies to the styles to all <div> tags and <p> tags that also have the class .no-indent.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>For those who like long charts, the full list of css tags and their values can be found here [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/propidx.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/propidx.html&sa=D&ust=1512061793337000&usg=AFQjCNHiNQzibH7C7CJImunu89VTaFOzXg)</span><span>]</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">A quick reference of the most common text-based CSS elements are here:</span>

*   <span class="c8">color -</span> <span class="c2">defines the color of the text in RGB format, also known as hex code: #RRGGBB where the number is 3 pairs of hex numbers that denote the amount of Red, Green, and Blue. #FFFFFF is white, #000000 is black, #FF0000 is red, etc. Additionally, you can also use the rgba() function to define the color in demical format. This also lets you define an alpha (transparency). While hex notation is universally supported, rgba is less so.</span>
*   <span class="c8">text-align -</span> <span class="c2">defines the alignment. Values: left, right, center, justify.</span>
*   <span class="c8">text-indent -</span> <span class="c2">defines the amount of space that should be displayed at the beginning of the element. Values in px (pixels) or em (relative).</span>
*   <span class="c8">font-size -</span> <span class="c2">defines the size of the font. Values in px or em.</span>
*   <span class="c8">font-family -</span> <span class="c2">defines which font to use. Recommended you don’t use this for now. Will cover later.</span>
*   <span class="c8">font-weight -</span> <span class="c2">defines how bold a font should be. Valid values 100 - 900 (400 normal, 600 is bold, 300 light).</span>
*   <span class="c8">font-style -</span> <span class="c2">defines if a font is italic or not. Values: normal, italic.</span>
*   <span class="c8">background-color -</span> <span class="c2">defines the background of the element. Values in #RRGGBB. Background color can also be defined in rgba().</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Understanding Cascading</span>

<span class="c2">As a reminder, the Cascading in CSS means that an element will take its highest form value if you enter conflicting information. So, if you had the following CSS:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-color: #FF0000;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">#first_paragraph {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-color: #00FF00;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">and the html:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><p id="first_paragraph">This is first</p></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The font color would be green (#00FF00) because the ID is higher order than the tag. The order is style, id, class, then tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 2:</span>

<span class="c2">Your assignment is to modify the newly created style.css and give your paragraphs a text-indent and at least 2 other style attributes. Additionally, give the first paragraph an ID, remove its indent and make the font size larger than the other paragraphs.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 3 - CSS Part 2</span>

*   <span class="c2">The box model</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">CSS defines more than just the way text displays. It also defines all of the visual aspects and positioning of every element in an HTML page. All html elements are defined in one of two groups -- inline and block. Inline elements ignore all positioning and special formatting (or, put another way, only respect the text-specific formatting). Block elements respect all CSS.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The inline elements are listed here [</span><span class="c7">[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Inline_elements](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Inline_elements&sa=D&ust=1512061793341000&usg=AFQjCNGaicGvrIpcD6MzUa5rAcT7QiJhTg)</span><span class="c2">] but a short list of common ones is below:</span>

*   <span class="c2"><b></span>
*   <span class="c2"><i></span>
*   <span class="c2"><span> (like a div, but inline, whereas <div> is block)</span>
*   <span class="c2"><a> (used for links)</span>
*   <span class="c2"><img></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If you have something like an image that you want to be treated as a block element, you can use the CSS: "display" with value "block" to overwrite the default of inline. Example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">img {</span>

<span class="c2">        display: block;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">You may not specify the height, width, or border for any item that is inline. You need to change its display to inline-block or block to set either of those properties.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Block and the Box Model</span>

<span>All items that are block items fit into the box model [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp&sa=D&ust=1512061793343000&usg=AFQjCNEEJG0HyOicNpgywq9CM5i0NOFFtw)</span><span class="c2">]. The box model means that all block elements have properties that apply to their content, padding, border, and margin.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Content</span>

<span class="c2">The CSS properties height, width, and background-color affect the content.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Padding</span>

<span class="c2">Padding is the space around an object that separates it from text and other objects on the page. The CSS properties padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, and padding-bottom (or just padding if you want a uniform padding) as well as background color affect the area considered the padding.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Border</span>

<span>The CSS property border [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp&sa=D&ust=1512061793345000&usg=AFQjCNGjZBxPc1oSV3V6ZKPVaYbYiLI6gQ)</span><span class="c2">] effects the border.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Margin</span>

<span class="c2">The CSS properties margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, and margin-bottom (or just margin if you want a uniform margin) affect the margin. The margin is extra spacing around an element outside of the border.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">A note about sizing</span>

<span class="c2">If you set your content width to 100px, with a padding of 5px, a border of 1 px, and a margin of 10px, the total width is 132px. Left margin of 10 + left border of 1 + left padding of 5 + 100 content + right padding of 5 + right border of 1 + right margin of 10 = 132\. This is a point that can get tricky for many people - as they may set a container to be 600 px wide and put 6 elements in that are each 100 px wide yet only 5 display with the 6th on the last line, forgetting that margin, padding, and border all add to the total width.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Percentages</span>

<span class="c2">Font sizing, as I’ve noted, is measured in px (pixels) or ems. When sizing and adding padding/margin, you can use px or ems, and you can also use percentages. Any item with a percentage as a width or height will be a percent of its container -- not the entire document. If the container does not have a set height or width, the item will grow to its container until it meets something that does have a height or width (or it reaches the size of the browser window).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Floats, dropcaps, and flair</span>

<span class="c2">Using what we know about the box model, we will now go back to our document and add some flair. In writing, we have two decorations that are frequently used - large caps and dropcaps. Large caps make the first letter of the first paragraph large and styled, dropcaps does the same but lines the top of the letter with the top of the rest of the text.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The first thing we need to do is to mark up the HTML. Let’s go back to our first paragraph and wrap the first letter in a span:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><p><span class="large_first">T</span>his is my first paragraph. It goes on and on and on…</p></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">You may want to add more text to see how things wrap, but not necessary for the example.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Now, load your HTML file. The span should not be visually noticeable, as we haven’t added any styles to it. First, let’s style it to be a large cap. Edit your style.css file and add a new declaration:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">.large_first {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-size: 3em;</span>

<span class="c2">        font-weight: 600;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Save style.css and reload your HTML file. The first letter is now large and bold. You may notice that the line-height for the first line is now larger than the rest. This can be fixed by setting your line height for your p tag. Example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p {</span>

<span class="c2">        line-height: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Now we’ll want to make it a dropcap. To do this, we need to use a block element. To avoid having to change our HTML code, we will do this in CSS:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">.large_first {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-size: 3em;</span>

<span class="c2">        font-weight: 600;</span>

<span>        </span><span class="c6">float: left;</span>

<span class="c6">        line-height: 1em;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">To make the element sink, we’ve applied the css style "float" and told the item to float to the left. Float tells the document to wrap text and other objects around the content. You can float content left or right. Additionally we have to set the line-height (if you did not set the default line height for <p> tags, then you may not need to override this, but it doesn’t hurt to be specific).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If you load this up, you’ll realize that the paragraph text is right next to the first letter. You’ll want to add a little bit of spacing by adding the margin property.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">.large_first {</span>

<span class="c2">        margin-right: 4px;</span>

<span class="c2">        font-size: 3em;</span>

<span class="c2">        font-weight: 600;</span>

<span class="c2">        float: left;</span>

<span class="c2">        line-height: 1em;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Documentation - where is it and how do you read it?</span>

<span class="c2">Like learning a spoken language, you can be considered conversational when you know 5-10% of a language. The same goes for programming. You can build many beautiful documents knowing only a few HTML tags and a few CSS styles. What is most important is that you know how to read documentation. When you want to do something that you are unsure how to do, documentation will be the key.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Here is the list of CSS styles, in case you need a reminder:</span>

<span>[</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/propidx.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/propidx.html&sa=D&ust=1512061793350000&usg=AFQjCNEjSRvQq1I15tSgb1qjaOV5dKQu1g)</span><span class="c2">]</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">This is a table of properties, their values, their defaults, and a few other items. While it doesn’t describe what they do, most of the properties are self-explanatory.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">The <img> tag</span>

<span>There are two ways you can place an image on a page, one is with the</span> <span class="c8"><img></span><span> tag, and the other is with the css property</span> <span class="c8">background-image</span><span>. For now, I’ll just go into detail of using the</span> <span class="c8"><img></span><span> tag. As noted above, the</span> <span class="c8"><img></span><span> tag is a self-closing tag, as well as an inline tag. Let’s start with our basic</span> <span class="c8"><img></span><span class="c2"> tag:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><img/></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">That tells the HTML document that there is an image, but what image? The next thing we need to add is an attribute named "src" for source.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><img src=""/></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>We need to give it an image. We’ll use this happy face:</span> <span class="c7">[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png&sa=D&ust=1512061793353000&usg=AFQjCNExrS1s0kxTsm5v5_z5QlJ6jk7a8Q)</span>

<span class="c2">Putting it all together we have:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span><img src="</span><span class="c7">[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D/&sa=D&ust=1512061793354000&usg=AFQjCNGEs-8-5CxWdntSIjCro08yCxdtsQ)</span><span class="c7">["](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252Fe%252Fec%252FHappy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D%252F%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGRH_OaHSOxjPCv5W9f9r4BvgVFMg&sa=D&ust=1512061793355000&usg=AFQjCNFsEaxQetxrxYG-UYnycXBAM5jKAw)</span><span class="c7">[/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D/&sa=D&ust=1512061793355000&usg=AFQjCNHYAfFBVFaWnHvxPJpiJ3RlX5K3vQ)</span><span class="c2">></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Put this into our HTML document and you’ll see a huge smiley face. Since it is pretty big, we’ll want to size the image. We’ll use an ID.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span><img id="smiley_face" src="</span><span class="c7">[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D/&sa=D&ust=1512061793357000&usg=AFQjCNEX85qEjsxmGNUfqO5BAnLHh1E_pA)</span><span class="c7">["](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252Fe%252Fec%252FHappy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D%252F%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGRH_OaHSOxjPCv5W9f9r4BvgVFMg&sa=D&ust=1512061793358000&usg=AFQjCNF4ZS7c3wZcXa774TypO1xdKoOZ0A)</span><span class="c7">[/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Happy_smiley_face.png%25E2%2580%259D/&sa=D&ust=1512061793358000&usg=AFQjCNG1OIyomIC1bbPvSuHay2sn4rhvLg)</span><span class="c2">></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Now let’s edit our style.css document and add the lines:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">#smiley_face {</span>

<span class="c2">        width: 150px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c11 c8 c5">A note about image sizing</span>

<span class="c2">An image will keep the same proportions if you give it only one dimension. So if you only give it a height or a width, it will simply shrink or grow. If you give it both a height and a width, it will distort to fit those exact sizes.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 3:</span>

<span class="c2">Modify your HTML and CSS documents to include two more images. You can find any image on the internet, right-click on it, and copy the image source to insert into your document. (For now, use images that are already on the web so I can see the images. If they are local image files on your computer, you’ll have to send those as well.) Use what we’ve learned about classes, ids, dropcaps to insert an image into the document and have it float right so the text wraps around it. Add a margin so that the text doesn’t come right next to the image.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 4 - Pseudo Classes & states</span>

<span class="c2">CSS can do some extremely powerful things. While much of that can be done using direct tags, classes, etc, there is a second type of class called a pseudo-class which is derived from a state, or ordering.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The full documentation on pseudo can be found at w3 [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html&sa=D&ust=1512061793360000&usg=AFQjCNFIXWVs5dG_CuH-DNSloPsHL4sA3Q)</span><span class="c2">].</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">For demonstration and to get you started, I’m going to focus on the :hover, :active and :first-child pseudo classes. All pseudo classes start with a colon (:).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">:hover</span>

<span class="c2">The :hover pseudo class defines the styles for when your mouse or pointer is hovering over the element. Note: Content that appears when you are hovering will not appear on touchscreen devices.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">:active</span>

<span class="c2">The :active pseudo class defines the styles for when an item has been clicked/touched. Unlike :hover, this works on touch screen devices.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">:first-child</span>

<span class="c2">The :first-child pseudo class applies to the first element in a collection.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The best way to see what these do is to see them in action. Edit your style.css document and add the following:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p:hover {</span>

<span class="c2">        color: #00FF00;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p:active {</span>

<span class="c2">color: #0000FF;</span>

<span class="c2">font-weight: 600;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Save, then reload your HTML document. Move your mouse over any paragraph, and you’ll see the text color change. Click the paragraph and it will change again and become bold. You can change any css property in these pseudo classes.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Using :first-child is a helpful form of shorthand because it saves you from having to add classes to your document for items that are first. It also allows you to quickly move content around in your document and ensure that things will display correctly. To give a visual, let’s add the following to our style.css:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p:first-child {</span>

<span class="c2">        font-style: italic;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The first paragraph on the page will appear italic, while the rest will remain normal. Where first-child gets more powerful is when combined with the</span> <span class="c8">></span><span> condition.</span> <span class="c8">></span> <span class="c2">means "direct child of".</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">For example, take the following HTML:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><div></span>

<span>        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p><span>...</span></p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2"></div></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><div></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p><span>...</span></p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2">        <p>...</p></span>

<span class="c2"></div></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If we wanted to apply our styles to the first <p> tag in each division (<div>) then we’d use: div > p:first-child { … }</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 4:</span>

<span class="c2">Add two more sections to your document with paragraph content. Style the first paragraphs of each of those sections differently using pseudo classes. Additionally, style your paragraphs uniquely using :hover and :active.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 5 - An Introduction to CSS3 & Media Queries</span>

<span>CSS3 is the latest revision of CSS. The CSS2 spec focused mainly on the display of content. Originally, CSS2 dealt in static display and focused on the simple and logical display of content. CSS3 focuses on animation, complex layouts, vertical text, and other, more complex elements. Its support within e-readers is limited (pretty much only iBooks and web-based readers accept any amount of CSS3). Even amongst modern browsers, support is limited. That said, it’s the future of CSS. It does some wonderful things, and many of its features are fairly universal.</span>

*   <span>What</span> <span class="c5">works</span><span class="c2"> in CSS3</span>

<span>One of the best resources in HTML/CSS development is "Can I Use" :</span> <span class="c7">[http://caniuse.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://caniuse.com/&sa=D&ust=1512061793366000&usg=AFQjCNFl3dQn8z2iWa-5621TaNBLqGE0DA)</span>

<span class="c2">It lists the compatibility of every HTML and CSS feature in all browsers. While it doesn’t cover reading systems, you can usually find a good substitute.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Below is a list of some CSS3 properties that are well-supported and heavily used:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c8">border-radius</span><span class="c2">: This creates a radius around the corners of the box model. This rounds the border itself, while padding and margins are left untouched.</span>
*   <span class="c8">transition</span><span class="c2">: This defines a set of parameters to determine a smooth animation when changing an attribute value. For example, you can set a transition of 1s, and if you change the width of an item, it will grow over the span of 1 second.</span>
*   <span class="c8">animations/keyframes:</span> <span class="c2">This allows you to create a list of properties based on a timeline that an element will cycle through. That way, your element will transition from one state to the next.</span>
*   <span class="c8">Transform:</span> <span class="c2">Transform lets you rotate an object along a three-dimensional plane. CSS2 was based on two-dimensional x and y coordinates with a fake z axis that really was just a layer (what items will display on top of other items). Transform lets you skew elements in ways you could not before.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>A full list of CSS3 properties can be found here:</span> <span class="c7">[http://www.quackit.com/css/css3/properties/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.quackit.com/css/css3/properties/&sa=D&ust=1512061793367000&usg=AFQjCNH6q9Utc3mQ4-xOkJkgOtN_uRR9lw)</span><span class="c2">.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>CSS3 is very useful, especially when paired with JavaScript.</span><span class="c2"> </span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">What is to come in CSS3</span>

<span>Column, vertical writing, and many other properties are to come. For a full list of working groups and statuses, you can check out the w3c css page [</span><span class="c7">[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work.en.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work.en.html&sa=D&ust=1512061793368000&usg=AFQjCNHuSV8eisK-1R7hD1A2aP0XLkJ9wA)</span><span class="c2">].</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">CSS3 allows you to decouple your display and content structure even more than in the past. It also allows you to define a really interesting set of user interface patterns.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Media Queries</span>

<span class="c2">CSS allows you to create responsive layouts using something called a media query. Media queries can be used in one of two ways. One is to conditionally load a CSS file, the other is to conditionally load specific CSS within a css file.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The most often-used queries are:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c8">max-width:</span> <span class="c2">Any display with this width or less.</span>
*   <span class="c8">min-width</span><span class="c2">: Any display with at least this much width.</span>
*   <span class="c8">max-height:</span> <span class="c2">Any display with this height or less.</span>
*   <span class="c8">min-height:</span> <span class="c2">Any display with at least this much height.</span>
*   <span class="c8">orientation:</span> <span class="c2">Landscape or portrait.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>You can see full documentation on media queries here: [</span><span class="c7">[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries&sa=D&ust=1512061793370000&usg=AFQjCNF77TmF3JYgw6nHoKDXUTc0bGJvGg)</span><span class="c2">]</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">To conditionally load a CSS file, use this format:</span>

<span class="c2"><link rel="stylesheet" media="(max-width: 800px)" href="example.css" /></span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c2">To conditionally load CSS within a CSS file, you use the media query as such:</span>

<span class="c2">@media (max-width: 800px) {</span>

<span class="c2">p {</span>

<span class="c2">font-size: 16px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>While media queries are often used to alter the display between devices (and therefore format the same HTML optimally for phones, tablets, and desktops), you can test media queries simply by resizing your browser window.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 5:</span>

<span class="c2">Create two media queries for your HTML document. Have your drop caps change to a smaller font size for phones (max width 500px) and a medium sized font for tablets (max width 1024px). Additionally, add at least one div that makes use of a CSS3 style element. It need not be one listed in this lesson.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 6 - JavaScript - what and how</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c6">Interactivity & Frameworks</span>

<span class="c2">HTML and CSS are static, meaning that what you write is what you get. Even with CSS’s state-based pseudo-classes, the ability to have interactive elements, complex animations, or anything mutable is drastically limited. To add interactivity, JavaScript was introduced. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that allows you to directly manipulate the HTML document (also known as the DOM or Document Object Model). JavaScript can be used as a stand-alone language to perform tasks and do computation, but I will focus on its use within the context of an HTML/CSS website.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Note about ebooks</span>

<span class="c2">As of this course, the only reading system that supports JavaScript is iBooks and web-based e-reading systems (and even some of the web-based systems disable JavaScript). Nonetheless, it used in nearly every website you visit and is the core of interactivity. A basic knowledge of JavaScript will arm you with the ability to create amazing and wonderful things.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">JavaScript Frameworks & Existing Code</span>

<span class="c2">Web-based JavaScript has an extremely plentiful amount of open source frameworks and plugins. These are pre-written sets of code that are meant to make complex tasks easier, or to enable you to add complex interactivity very simply. While the code behind many of these frameworks and widgets is extremely complex, they are created in such a way that they are very easy to include in your document.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The most widely-used framework is jQuery (</span><span class="c7">[http://jquery.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://jquery.com/&sa=D&ust=1512061793373000&usg=AFQjCNFbbqWVXuEUgbscJbKK-20hinOmsQ)</span><span class="c2">). jQuery serves a few purposes:</span>

*   <span class="c5">It handles compatibility really well</span><span class="c2">. Functions that are normally only available to more modern browsers get special support within jQuery so that your code will work in the largest amount of web browsers.</span>
*   <span class="c5">It makes things a little bit easier to do.</span><span class="c2"> Its original goal -- and why the "query" is in its name -- was to make it really simple to find specific elements on the page and modify their properties. What used to require many lines of JavaScript code can be done in 1 line of jQuery that is much easier to read.</span>
*   <span class="c5">It allows for very simple plugins.</span> <span>There is a very large development community that build jQuery plugins. There is an official repository here (</span><span class="c7">[http://plugins.jquery.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://plugins.jquery.com/&sa=D&ust=1512061793374000&usg=AFQjCNF1juMM7mv2-6EmanhI9P2Tv8SeDg)</span><span class="c2">) but a google search for "jquery plugin [what you want to do]" will yield many additional results. These plugins simply require you to include a JavaScript file in your page and write only a few lines of code. We will explore using a slideshow widget later in this lesson.</span>

<span> </span>

<span class="c2">jQuery is so widely used that Google provides a hosted version of the script. This allows for caching of the file, which can reduce loading time for visitors. To take advantage of this, you can (and should) include the following code to your HTML document in the <head> tag:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c23"><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">The absolute basics</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">JavaScript, like CSS, can be inserted into multiple places within your document. The recommended usage is to include all of your JavaScript in an external file (like your CSS). If you need to include JavaScript within an HTML document, it needs to be included within a <script> tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let’s start by creating and including a JavaScript file. Under the line where you included jQuery to your HTML document add the code:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"><script src="script.js"></script></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Next, create a new text document and save it as "script.js" wherever you have your index.html saved. Because we are including this file in a <script> tag, we do not need to duplicate the script tag within the script.js file.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let us start by writing our first line of JavaScript (well, for some of you your first line.). Add the following:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">alert("Hello World!");</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Why Hello World?</span>

<span class="c2">It is a programming thing. The first program you should write should tell you “Hello, world!” It’s tradition.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Save the file and reload your index.html. It should pop up a window saying "Hello World!"</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">What does object-oriented mean?</span>

<span class="c2">I mentioned above that JavaScript is object-oriented. That means that everything within JavaScript that you deal with is an object. Each object has a type, which carries along with it a set of properties and functions. A real-world example is a car. A car would be a type of object and every car would have a gas pedal that, when pressed, makes the car go. A car also has a brake pedal that, when pressed, makes the car stop, and a steering wheel that turns the car. And so on. Every instance of a car has the same functions (although you can change the properties of each instance of a car, such as its color, make, number of doors, etc).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">To use any functions of an object you use the period (.) followed by the function you want to use.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">For example, if we take a string and want to replace its contents we can use:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">alert("JavaScript is OK".replace("OK","Great!"));</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">If you run that, it will alert you "JavaScript is Great!"</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>In this instance, the ".replace()" function is like the brake. Just as the brake enables you to stop in every car, the .replace() function enables you to replace properties with other properties. In every string of JavaScript, this function does the same thing to every string object.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>You may have noticed that every line of JavaScript (instruction) is ended with a semicolon (;). While it is not always necessary to do this, I highly recommend it.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Functions</span>

<span>Along with having objects, JavaScript also has functions. A function takes input and provides output. A function can technically take no inputs, and could provide no output (but then it wouldn’t really be very useful.). The notation for writing a function is to use the word</span> <span class="c8">function.</span><span class="c2"> For example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">function makeMeHappy(str) {</span>

<span class="c2">        return str.replace("sad","happy");</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In this function, we are taking the input of "str" and returning that string with "sad" replaced with happy. To call this function, we use the line:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">alert(makeMeHappy("I am very sad"));</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">which will alert "I am very happy".</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Notes on naming conventions:</span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c2">You can name your objects, variables, and functions anything you wish. (Well, almost. There are special characters you have to avoid using, and you cannot start with a number.) But there are a few conventions that are used to make code easier to read and understand.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c8">Variables -</span> <span class="c2">All lowercase, usually broken up with underscores ("_"). Variables should be descriptive, for example: "number_of_clicks" and "name_of_user".</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c8">Functions -</span> <span class="c2">Lowercase first letter, capitalize the words after. Example: makeMeHappy, removeDropCaps, makeTextBlack, etc. Functions do something, so their names should be descriptive action words. This will make your code very easy to read and understand.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c8">Objects -</span> <span class="c2">Capitalize every word, no underscores. An object is a thing, so they should be named logically. For example: User, Box, GameBoard, etc. Until you get into more complex JavaScript programming you will not need to be creating objects, you will simply be using existing objects.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">The Document Object Model (DOM)</span>

<span class="c2">The DOM, or Document Object Model, is the JavaScript representation of the HTML and CSS that you see on the page. Changing anything to the DOM will update the HTML on the page to match accordingly.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In jQuery, you select elements very similarly to the way you would in CSS. It is important to note that any changes to CSS using JavaScript happen at the actual item level, so it will overwrite any prior CSS you may have (the item is the highest level). JavaScript cannot be used to edit the actual CSS.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let’s start by using jQuery to select all paragraphs and make their font grey (#CCCCCC):</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$("p").css("color","#CCCCCC");</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Add that line to your JavaScript file (remove the alert statement), then save. When you reload your index.html, it will display all the paragraph text in grey.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let’s break the statement down. Any jQuery statement starts with $. Then it is followed by the query, which is within quotations (""). We wanted to select our <p> tag, so, like in CSS, we simply used "p". We could also select classes and ids like this:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$(".smiley_face").css("width","100px"); // for class "smiley_face" make 100 px wide</span>

<span class="c2">$("#first_paragraph").css("font-size","2em"); // make id first_paragraph 2em font-size</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Comments</span>

<span class="c2">In JavaScript, you can insert comments (non-interpreted code) by using // or /* */. Anything that follows // is ignored by JavaScript. Anything between the ** within /* */ is also ignored. Comments are used to help you remember what it is you are trying to do, and to make it easier for others to read your code. Examples of good comments:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">//Create the variables for saving state</span>

<span class="c2">/* This function will take in a string and replace "sad" with "happy" */</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Comments with // must be on the same line. Comments using /* */ can span multiple lines.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">The event stack/Interactivity</span>

<span>Simply changing CSS via JavaScript isn’t terribly interesting - as we could just set the CSS and be done. Where things get interactive is when you start working with events. For simplicity, we’ll focus on the events that jQuery offers (which may be a complete list of events, but some browsers may have other odd unique events). You can see a full list of events here [</span><span class="c7">[http://api.jquery.com/category/events/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://api.jquery.com/category/events/&sa=D&ust=1512061793383000&usg=AFQjCNGZnftvVL-L3VRdTQuXCenlks66QQ)</span><span class="c2">] but I’ll be discussing the following events:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c8">.change() -</span> <span class="c2">Triggers when the value of an element changes (applies only to form elements, so we won’t cover it much until later).</span>
*   <span class="c8">.click() -</span> <span class="c2">Triggers when an object is clicked or tapped (on a touch screen).</span>
*   <span class="c8">.dblclick() -</span> <span class="c2">Triggers when an object is double-clicked or double-tapped.</span>
*   <span class="c8">.hover() -</span> <span class="c2">Triggers when you move your mouse over an object (does not trigger for touch screens).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The rest of the events are very useful for doing complex interactions, but for most basic things, the four above will serve perfectly.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Waiting for the document to be ready</span>

<span class="c2">JavaScript loads in the order the scripts are included. Additionally, some scripts take longer to load than others, and could possibly run before your document has fully loaded. To prevent any sort of conflict, jQuery has added an amazingly wonderful function:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$("document").ready(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">        //CODE GOES IN HERE</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">What this function does is delay the execution of any code within until everything is loaded and ready to go. Most -- if not all -- of your JavaScript will go here (the only thing outside of here would be declaring variables or functions).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Let us start by clearing out the contents of our script.js file and adding the following:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$("document").ready(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">        $("p").click(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">                $(this).remove();</span>

<span class="c2">        });</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Let me first walk you through the code. We have our</span> <span class="c8">$("document").ready</span><span> which I already discussed. The next item we have is our selector:</span> <span class="c8">$("p")</span><span>. This means everything that follows applies to all of our paragraph tags. Following the selector, we have</span> <span class="c8">.click()</span><span class="c2"> which means that we are setting the functionality for a click action.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The functionality is going to be a function, so we use</span> <span class="c8">function()</span><span>. All the code for that function is going to go between</span> <span class="c8">{</span><span> and</span> <span class="c8">}</span><span>. The code for that function in "</span><span class="c8">$(this).remove();</span><span class="c2">"</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Let’s talk about the 2nd part. The</span> <span class="c8">.remove();</span><span> is a jquery function that deletes the DOM object (and the HTML) from the visible document. That means the object will simply disappear. The first part is</span> <span class="c8">$(this)</span><span>. The</span> <span class="c8">$()</span><span> is required to say that something is a jQuery object (and we can use the jQuery functions on it).</span> <span class="c8">this</span><span class="c2"> is a reserved keyword to refer to the object that is being acted on.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Since there are multiple <p> tags in our document, we don’t want to remove</span> <span class="c5">all</span><span> of them, just the one that is being clicked. We can do that using</span> <span class="c8">this</span><span class="c2">.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Save your script.js file and reload your index.html. Now, try to click on any paragraph. When you do so, it will delete.</span> <span class="c5">Don’t worry. This is temporary</span><span class="c2">. Changes to the DOM do not actually save to the file, they are display only. If you want all of your content back, just reload the page.</span>

<span class="c2"> </span>

<span class="c2">Removing items is great, but most likely it is not what you want to do. For the next example, we’re going to create a font size changer. It will require us to create two buttons in HTML - one to increase the font size, one to reduce the font size.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Adding the HTML</span>

<span class="c6"></span>

<span class="c2">We’ll need to edit our index.html and add our two buttons. While you could technically use a div, span, or any other element, we’ll use the <button> element.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Add this to your index.html at the bottom before the </body> tag:</span>

<span class="c2"><button id="increase_font_size">+</button></span>

<span class="c2"><button id="decrease_font_size">-</button></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Add this to your style.css file</span>

<span class="c2">#increase_font_size {</span>

<span class="c2">        position: fixed;</span>

<span class="c2">        top: 8px;</span>

<span class="c2">        left: 8px;</span>

<span class="c2">        height: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">        width: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">#decrease_font_size {</span>

<span class="c2">        position: fixed;</span>

<span class="c2">        top: 46px;</span>

<span class="c2">        left: 8px;</span>

<span class="c2">        height: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">        width: 32px;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Absolute Positioning</span>

<span>If you want to specify the display location of an item, you can tell it to position the item in a fixed place by using</span> <span class="c8">position: fixed;</span><span>. Then, you define a top or bottom, left or right (which will put the items left, top, bottom, or right at that position on the page). You can define position in px or %. You can also position something absolutely, using</span> <span class="c8">position: absolute;</span><span class="c2"> which will place it on top of other elements. The difference between fixed and absolute is that absolute will scroll with the document, while fixed will remain in place even if the document scrolls.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">This CSS will position the items at the top left of the page.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Remove the old code from your script.js file and add this:</span>

<span class="c2">var current_font_size = 16;</span>

<span class="c2">$("document").ready(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">        $("#increase_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">                current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span>

<span class="c2">                $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c2">        });</span>

<span class="c2">        $("#decrease_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">                current_font_size = current_font_size - 2;</span>

<span class="c2">                $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c2">        });</span>

<span class="c2">        $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Save your script.js file and reload your index.html. Click on the + or - button to see the font size of all your paragraphs change.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">What is the code doing?</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>First let’s look at the first line:</span> <span class="c8">var current_font_size = 16;</span><span>  In JavaScript, if you want to store any value, you need to use a variable. JavaScript requires you initialize a variable by declaring it with "var". So, the statement is</span> <span class="c8">var [name of your variable] = [something]</span><span class="c2">.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>In this case, we named our variable "current_font_size" (descriptive and tells us what is stored in it). The value after the = is an object. JavaScript makes an object out of</span> <span class="c5">everything.</span> <span class="c2">(There is a concept of a primitive, for which numbers can fall, but for simplicity sake, I won’t get into them.) 16 is a Number object. So, I can take that number and perform a function on it, for example: 16.toFixed(2); which will display the number as "16.00" (fixed decimal places).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Now that we have our variable initialized and it has a value, we can use it and modify it later.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Next, we have our jQuery code - which is all inside the</span> <span class="c8">$("document").ready()</span> <span class="c2">function.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">We have 2 click actions that essentially do the same thing, so I’ll just talk about one, as it applies to both.</span>

<span class="c2">$("#increase_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">                current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span>

<span class="c2">                $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c2">        });</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The first thing I’ll note is the tab indenting. With JavaScript, instead of tags <> we have</span> <span class="c8">{</span><span> and</span> <span class="c8">}</span><span> which denote "ownership" (blocks of code). To keep track, I’ve indented every time I have an open</span> <span class="c8">{</span><span> and reduce every time I have a</span> <span class="c8">}</span><span class="c2">. This make the code easy to see what belongs where.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>We have our selector:</span> <span class="c8">$("#increase_font_size").</span><span> This selects the HTML element with the ID of "i</span><span class="c8">ncrease_font_size</span><span>" which is our button that we want to increase the font size. Now let’s look inside the function. Next, we are going to change the variable</span> <span class="c8">current_font_size</span><span>. The new value we want is the old value + 2\. So, we have:</span> <span class="c8">current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span><span class="c8 c5"> </span><span>There is actually a secondary notation we could use, which is</span> <span class="c8">+=</span><span>. We could write this as:</span> <span class="c8">current_font_size += 2;</span><span class="c2"> Both statements would give you the same result, but I find the first is easier for beginners to read.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>So we’ve changed our variable. Now we need to change our paragraphs. We first select all the p tags:</span> <span class="c8">$("p")</span><span> and modify their css:</span> <span class="c6">.css("");</span>

<span class="c2">We want to modify the property "font-size" and we want to set the value to our current font size. Because the font size value needs to be in pixels or ems, we have to specify. We do that by adding the string "px" to the result, which gives us:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>$("p").css("font-size",</span><span class="c8">current_font_size+"px"</span><span class="c2">);</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>If we were to leave out the</span> <span class="c5">+"px"</span> <span class="c2">then the browser wouldn’t know the dimensions and things would not display as expected.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The decrease_font_size is the same, but with a -. Again, we could use -= if we wanted, to reduce the value, but both are fine.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Getting current values</span>

<span>If you want to</span> <span class="c5">determine</span><span class="c2"> a css value instead of set it, you only put in the first parameter. So, if you wanted to get the font size, instead of set it you would do:</span>

<span class="c2">$("p").css("font-size");</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">In the above case, there are many paragraphs, so the result would actually be an array (list) of values.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">An IF statement</span>

<span>The most powerful statement in programming is the</span> <span class="c8">IF THEN ELSE</span><span class="c2"> statement. It allows you to make a determination and do different things based on it. It is what adds intelligence to applications. In JavaScript, the notation of an if statement is very simple:</span>

<span class="c2">if (condition) {</span>

<span class="c2">        //Run this code if the condition is true</span>

<span class="c2">} else {</span>

<span class="c2">        //run this code if the condition is false</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The</span><span class="c8"> </span><span class="c8 c5">else { }</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c2">section is optional.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The condition must be something that equates to a true or false. For example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">if (current_font_size < 10) //if the font size is less than 10</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">is fine whereas:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">if ($("p").css("font-size")) //this is not good</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Using the “if” to prevent crazy</span>

<span class="c2">Let’s use an “if” statement to prevent the user from increasing or decreasing the font to be too large or too small. Let’s start with too large.</span>

<span class="c2">Originally we had</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$("#increase_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span class="c2">        current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span>

<span class="c2">        $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">We will add our “if” statement:</span>

<span class="c2">$("#increase_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span>        </span><span class="c4">if (current_font_size <= 26) {</span>

<span class="c2">        current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span>

<span class="c2">                $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c4">}</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>As you can see we had to indent the code a little more. Secondly, we have our statement,</span> <span class="c8">if (current_font_size < 26)</span><span class="c5"> </span><span class="c2">which prevents the code from executing if the font size is 26 or more.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>Let’s say we want to alert the user why things aren’t getting bigger, we can use</span> <span class="c8 c5">else</span><span class="c8"> </span><span class="c2">for that:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">$("#increase_font_size").click(function() {</span>

<span>        </span><span class="c4">if (current_font_size <= 26) {</span>

<span class="c2">        current_font_size = current_font_size + 2;</span>

<span class="c2">                $("p").css("font-size",current_font_size+"px");</span>

<span class="c4">} else {</span>

<span class="c4">        alert("Cannot increase the font size any more!");</span>

<span class="c4">}</span>

<span class="c2">});</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c5">Challenge</span> <span class="c4">6:</span>

<span>Your assignment is to add the</span> <span class="c8 c5">if then else</span><span class="c2"> statement to the reduce_font_size button with a lower limit of 10\.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 7 - JavaScript - Using others’ scripts</span>

<span class="c2">Chances are, someone else has written code that does what you’d like to do - especially if you’re looking to do something common. Beyond it being done before, there is a good chance that the code has been turned into a widget and has documentation on how to use it. One of the best ways to learn JavaScript is to copy other people’s scripts and modify them for yourself. It will allow you to do very complex things quickly and learn from people with more experience.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">A Google search for "JavaScript function to do [something]" will yield you very good results, or even "How do I do [something] in JavaScript." As noted, I’m going to focus mostly on jQuery as one of the benefits from jQuery is the ability to create and package widgets. This allows code to be cleaner and easier to copy/paste.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

*   <span class="c2">Where to find good scripts</span>

*   <span class="c2">How to read documentation</span>

<span>For the rest of this lesson, we’re going to learn to implement a jQuery slideshow. There are more than a handful of plugins for this, but we’ll use JSSOR (</span><span class="c7">[http://www.jssor.com/](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jssor.com/&sa=D&ust=1512061793405000&usg=AFQjCNFdxieqltV7Q1agr6CxFEE30t5pDw)</span><span class="c2">). It is very good and has tons of options.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>The basic documentation can be found here:</span> <span class="c7">[http://www.jssor.com/developement/index.html#.UuXd9fYo600](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jssor.com/developement/index.html%23.UuXd9fYo600&sa=D&ust=1512061793406000&usg=AFQjCNF19rOViP3Lgd_322GiTzCh9-_2_w)</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">I’ve copied that page and modified to fit the model of our index.html, script.js, and style.css:</span>

<span class="c8 c5 c11">Javscript to be insert into the <head> of your HTML</span>

<span class="c15"><!-- it works the same with all jquery version from 1.3.1 to 2.0.3 --></span><span class="c2">  
<script src="jssor.slider.mini.js"></script>  
</span>

<span class="c11 c8 c5">JavaScript to be inserted into your script.js</span>

<span> </span><span class="c2"> $(document).ready(function ($) {  
   var options = { };  
   var jssor_slider1 = new $JssorSlider$('slider1_container', options);  
 });  
</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c11 c8 c5">HTML to be added to the <body> tag of index.html</span>

<span class="c2"><div id="slider1_container" style="position: relative;  
top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 600px; height: 300px;">  
 <!-- Slides Container -->  
 <div u="slides" style="cursor: move; position: absolute; overflow: hidden;  
 left: 0px; top: 0px; width: 600px; height: 300px;">  
   <div><img u="image" src="image1.jpg" /></div>  
   <div><img u="image" src="image2.jpg" /></div>  
 </div>  
</div></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>We will first need to download the JavaScript file for the slider widget. The entire source code is posted on GitHub, but here is a link to the one JavaScript file you need:</span> <span class="c7">[https://github.com/jssor/slider.js/blob/master/js/jssor.slider.mini.js](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/jssor/slider.js/blob/master/js/jssor.slider.mini.js&sa=D&ust=1512061793408000&usg=AFQjCNEv_yAigjiEhSXY_Bjg1_Oc0u7fHw)</span><span class="c2"> </span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Click the "copy to clipboard" button, and paste the contents into a new file, and save it as "jssor.slider.mini.js" in the same directory as your index.html file.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Now that we have the js, let’s add a few more images to the list of images. We have a <div> that contains a bunch of <div>s with <img> tags in them. You can copy one of those lines and paste it a few times, then search the internet for a few images. 4 or 5 should be enough for you to see the effects.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Once you have the images, save your index.html file, script.js and reload your index.html file and you will see a slideshow of images.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">Customizing The Slideshow</span>

<span>Our example above gave an empty object ( indicated by { } ). If we want to customize the slideshow, you only have to add options to our</span> <span class="c5">options</span><span class="c2"> variable. Taken from one of the examples in the GitHub repository I have:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">var options = {</span>

<span class="c2">        $AutoPlay: true,</span>

<span class="c2">        $DragOrientation: 3,</span>

<span class="c2">//[Optional] Orientation to drag slide, 0 no drag,</span>

<span class="c2">// 1 horizontal, 2 vertical, 3 either,</span>

<span class="c2">//default value is 1 (Note that the $DragOrientation should</span>

<span class="c2">// be the same as $PlayOrientation when $DisplayPieces</span>

<span class="c2">// is greater than 1, or parking position is not 0)</span>

<span class="c2">        $CaptionSliderOptions: {</span>

<span class="c2">          $Class: $JssorCaptionSlider$,</span>

<span class="c2">          $CaptionTransitions: _CaptionTransitions,</span>

<span class="c2">          $PlayInMode: 1,</span>

<span class="c2">          $PlayOutMode: 3</span>

<span class="c2">        }</span>

<span class="c2">      };</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Normally there is much better description of the options, but in this case, we just have to dig into the code of the examples to find out what the options are and what they do. This one will allow you to add captions to your images. You just need to add a div with the attribute "u" as "caption."</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>You can see the example here:</span> <span class="c7">[https://github.com/jssor/slider.js/blob/master/examples-jquery/slider-with-caption.source.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/jssor/slider.js/blob/master/examples-jquery/slider-with-caption.source.html&sa=D&ust=1512061793412000&usg=AFQjCNFtVGCklmu8LBIhkPGwEnaSnfaPpg)</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c4">Challenge 7:</span>

<span class="c2">Create a copy of your index.html and rename it to "assignment_7.html". Remove the slideshow code from it and implement one of the jQuery UI plugins.</span>

<span class="c2">You can use the Google Hosted jQuery ui here:</span>

<span class="c2"><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js"></script></span>

<span class="c2"></span>

## <span class="c16 c8">Area 8 - Putting it all together</span>

*   <span class="c2">Using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to create and manipulate a document</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">You’ve just learned years worth of HTML/CSS/JavaScript in only a few weeks. Well - in reality, I’ve equipped you with the core basics and the tools to grow and learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript. If you feel like things have gone fast - they have. This course is not meant to make you an expert, but to give you the confidence to learn how to find a solution. Ultimately there are a few concepts that you need to memorize to become fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">1) You don’t need to be XHTML strict, but you should strive for it.</span>

<span class="c2">Every HTML tag should have an open and a close tag. If it is a self-closing tag, don’t forget the closing />. Beyond being good form (and ensuring that your HTML will work perfectly in all ereader systems that require XHTML strict), it also makes it really easy to format your code using tabs which will make it very easy to read.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">2) Compartmentalize</span>

<span class="c2">HTML allows you to do many things that can form bad habits. Keep your JavaScript, your CSS, and your HTML separate. This will allow you to easily take your CSS or JavaScript to other projects. Additionally, as your code begins to grow, you can take out generic elements and move them to different files. You can include as many JavaScript or CSS files as you want, so have a blast.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">Additionally, your HTML should be grouped logically around your content. Don’t worry about display, all of that can be controlled in CSS.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">3) Understand the Cascading Order for CSS.</span>

<span class="c2">Item, ID, Class, Tag. Repeat: Item, ID, Class, Tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">As things get more specific, that is how they override. There is one exception to this. You can add "!important" after a value and it will override even more specific css. For example:</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">p {</span>

<span class="c2">color: #000000 !important;</span>

<span class="c2">}</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">The above will ensure that all paragraph text is black, no matter what CSS color change may be in class, id, or on the tag.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">4) JavaScript changes an element’s style only.</span>

<span class="c2">When using JavaScript to change an element, you can only change the element’s CSS. You can use jQuery to select all items with a specific class, but you are adding CSS to the object itself - which means it will override any previous styling that it has.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">5) Chances are, someone else has solved your problem.</span>

<span>One of my most-viewed websites is</span> <span class="c7">[http://stack-overflow.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://stack-overflow.com&sa=D&ust=1512061793416000&usg=AFQjCNGjVtSUQeVNwTDI5QkJOlNVpKEemg)</span><span> </span><span class="c2">It is a developer Q&A site where people ask and answer technical questions. You’ll find answers to everything from simple questions like "How do I add a jQuery plugin to my page?" to extremely advanced questions like "How do I modify the signature of a function to make it mutable?" Documentation exists all over the place.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>For simple things, you can check out</span> <span class="c7">[http://w3schools.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://w3schools.com&sa=D&ust=1512061793417000&usg=AFQjCNFDq6a9FPedEzI1bGvMAoA3OXTuxQ)</span><span>.</span><span class="c2"> (Be careful when it comes to advanced features. They tend to have less-than-useful information for complex items.)</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c6">6) JavaScript is deep, CSS is shallow, and HTML should be flat.</span>

<span class="c2">HTML has a limited number of tags. If your tags match and you are properly using classes and IDs to identify items and classify them, then you’ve got HTML down well. There are advanced uses for HTML, especially when you get into HTML5 canvas, but even then, the complexity comes in JavaScript).</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span class="c2">CSS has a wide variety of properties, all of which control some aspect of display. Knowing CSS doesn’t turn you into a user interface expert or a design expert, but it gives you the tools to implement tons of different complex and beautiful layouts. If you know just a few CSS properties, and where to look for documentation, then you’re set.</span>

<span class="c2"></span>

<span>JavaScript is a real programming language. A lot can be accomplished with just the ability to copy/paste and modify a few values, but it has the potential to completely break as well. For example, if you fail to put a semicolon (;) at the end of a line or enter a bad command, your JavaScript with throw an error to the console and fail to execute any code. Debugging can be quite a pain, but thankfully there are troubleshooting tools available, such as Firebug [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firebug/] for Firefox.</span>
