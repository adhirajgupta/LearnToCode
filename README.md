# LearnToCode
A collection of simple, basic, tutorials in many different languages to help anyone learn how to code

# Learn by Example
The goal is to have functioning examples that are easy to change.  They will all be well commented, and - for the most part - single purpose.  Each example will do one thing, as simply as possible.  Users can then copy/paste these examples, run them, and modify as they see fit.  An explanation of each tutorial will be available on my youtube (a link will be provided in each example).
